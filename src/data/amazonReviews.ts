      title: "Best gummy bears I've ever had",
      body: "Finally a gummy bear that tastes amazing AND doesn't have Red 40 or any artificial dyes. My kids love them and I feel good about what they're eating. The texture is perfect — soft and chewy, not hard or stale. Already ordered our second batch.",

      body: "We switched to these after learning about artificial food dyes. My kids don't notice the difference except they say these taste better than Haribo. The fruit flavors are distinct and natural tasting. The patriotic packaging is a nice touch too.",

      body: "Really good gummy bears with clean ingredients. Soft texture and each flavor is distinct. My only wish is that the bags were a little bigger — we go through them fast! The bundle deal helps though.",

      body: "Love knowing my money is going to an American company making products right here in the USA. The gummy bears themselves are excellent — not too sweet, great fruit flavors, and no weird aftertaste like some dye-free candies have.",
