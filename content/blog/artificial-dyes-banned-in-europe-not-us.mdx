Since 2010, the European Union has required a specific warning label on any food or drink containing certain artificial dyes. The label reads: "may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children."

That same year, many European food manufacturers reformulated their products to use natural colors rather than carry the warning. The result: candy that's sold under the same brand name can have different ingredient lists depending on which country you buy it in.

## The Six Dyes That Require EU Warning Labels

The EU's labeling requirement applies to six specific synthetic dyes, known as the "Southampton Six" after the 2007 University of Southampton study that linked them to hyperactive behavior in children:

- **Sunset Yellow (E110)** — known as Yellow 6 in the US
- **Quinoline Yellow (E104)** — not commonly used in the US
- **Carmoisine (E122)** — not commonly used in the US
- **Allura Red (E129)** — known as Red 40 in the US
- **Tartrazine (E102)** — known as Yellow 5 in the US
- **Ponceau 4R (E124)** — not commonly used in the US

Three of these six dyes — Red 40, Yellow 5, and Yellow 6 — are among the most commonly used food dyes in American candy.

## Same Brand, Different Ingredients

Several candy brands sell different versions of the same product depending on the market. The European version uses natural colors to avoid the warning label. The American version uses synthetic dyes.

This isn't a secret — it's visible on the ingredient labels. Companies have confirmed that different markets get different formulations. The reasons are commercial: reformulating is expensive, natural dyes can be harder to source at scale, and the US hasn't required the same warning labels.

## Why the US Took a Different Path

In 2011, an FDA advisory panel reviewed the same evidence that led to the EU warning labels. The panel voted against recommending similar labels in the United States, concluding that the available data was insufficient to establish a causal link between artificial dyes and hyperactivity in the general population.

That decision has been debated ever since. But the practical result is that the US food supply has continued to include synthetic dyes without warning labels, while European versions of the same products have moved toward natural alternatives.

## The Gap Is Closing

In 2025, the landscape started to shift:

- The FDA banned Red No. 3 nationwide
- The FDA approved new natural color additives
- Multiple major food companies announced dye-removal plans
- Federal policy has been pushing toward fewer synthetic additives

The US isn't at parity with EU regulations yet, but the direction is clear. What took Europe a regulatory mandate to achieve, the US market is approaching through a combination of consumer demand, state laws, and voluntary industry action.

## What This Means for Candy Shoppers

If you're buying candy in the US today:

- **The same brand name doesn't mean the same ingredients** across countries
- **Natural-colored versions exist** for some brands, but they may not be the default on US shelves
- **Reading the ingredient list is still the most reliable way** to know what's in your candy
- **Brands that launched without artificial dyes** didn't need to reformulate — their supply chain was built differently

At USA Gummies, we've used natural colors from fruit and vegetable extracts since our first product. We're also made in the USA, so our manufacturing isn't split between different standards for different markets. One formula, one country, one ingredient list.

The regulatory gap between Europe and the US has been narrowing. But for now, the ingredient label is the most reliable guide to what's actually in your candy — regardless of which country you're buying it in.
