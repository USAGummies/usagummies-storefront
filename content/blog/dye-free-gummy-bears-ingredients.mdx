If you are searching for dye-free gummy bears, understanding the ingredient list is the fastest way to shop with confidence. The [shop page](/shop) is a helpful reference while you compare products and labels.

This guide explains common gummy ingredients, typical natural color sources, and how to verify that a product is free from artificial dyes.

## The core ingredients in gummy bears

Most gummy bears share a similar foundation. You will often see a sweetener, a gelling agent, flavorings, and color sources. The exact formula varies by brand, but the structure is usually consistent.

## Common color sources in dye-free gummies

Dye-free gummy bears rely on natural color sources rather than synthetic dyes. Common examples include fruit and vegetable concentrates or other naturally derived ingredients. The exact source should be listed on the label.

## How to read a gummy bear ingredient list

Use a step-by-step approach:

1. Scan for any artificial dye names such as Red 40 or Yellow 5.
