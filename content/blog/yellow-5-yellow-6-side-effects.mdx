Red 40 gets most of the headlines, but Yellow 5 and Yellow 6 are the second and third most commonly used artificial food dyes in America. Together, they're in thousands of products — from candy and chips to mac and cheese and sports drinks.

If you've started reading ingredient labels, you've probably seen them. Here's what the research says about each one.

## Yellow 5: Tartrazine

**Also known as:** FD&C Yellow No. 5, Tartrazine, E102

Yellow 5 is one of the most widely used synthetic dyes in the world. It produces a bright lemon-yellow color and appears in:

- Candy (gummy bears, hard candy, candy corn)
- Snack chips and cheese-flavored products
- Soft drinks and sports beverages
- Boxed mac and cheese
- Cereals
- Cake mixes and frosting
- Some medications and vitamins

### What the Research Shows

**Hyperactivity:** Yellow 5 was one of the six dyes tested in the 2007 Southampton study that found artificial dyes increased hyperactive behavior in children. The EU now requires Yellow 5 to carry a warning label: "may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children."

**Allergic reactions:** Yellow 5 is one of the few food dyes specifically called out by the FDA for potential allergic reactions. The FDA requires Yellow 5 to be individually listed on ingredient labels (not just grouped as "artificial color") because some people experience hives, itching, or nasal congestion after consuming it. People with aspirin sensitivity appear to be at higher risk for tartrazine reactions.

**Contamination concerns:** A study by the nonprofit organization Purdue University researchers found that some batches of Yellow 5 contain trace amounts of benzidine, a known carcinogen. The FDA allows up to 1 part per billion of benzidine in food dyes — a threshold that some researchers argue is not adequately protective, especially for children who consume dyes daily.

**Genotoxicity:** Some laboratory studies have found that Yellow 5 can cause DNA damage in cell cultures at high concentrations. The real-world significance is debated, but these findings have contributed to growing regulatory scrutiny.

## Yellow 6: Sunset Yellow

**Also known as:** FD&C Yellow No. 6, Sunset Yellow FCF, E110

Yellow 6 produces a warm orange-yellow color. It's the third most used dye in the US and appears in:

- Candy and gummy products
- Orange-flavored snacks and drinks
- Bakery products (rolls, breadcrumbs)
- Cereals
- Sausage casings and some processed meats
- Gelatin desserts
- Some medications

### What the Research Shows

**Hyperactivity:** Like Yellow 5, Yellow 6 was included in the Southampton study and carries the same EU warning label about effects on children's attention and activity.

**Allergic reactions:** Yellow 6 can trigger allergic reactions including hives, nasal congestion, and in rare cases, anaphylaxis. People with aspirin sensitivity are again at elevated risk.

**Contamination:** Yellow 6 has also been found to contain trace amounts of carcinogens, including benzidine and 4-aminobiphenyl, as manufacturing byproducts. The amounts are within FDA-permitted limits, but critics point out that the limits were set decades ago and don't account for cumulative exposure from multiple sources.

**Adrenal tumors:** Early animal studies raised concerns about Yellow 6 and adrenal gland tumors in rodents. The FDA reviewed these findings and concluded the evidence was insufficient to warrant a ban, but some independent researchers disagree with that assessment.

## How Common Are These Dyes?

To give you a sense of scale:

- The average American child consumes an estimated **62 mg of artificial food dyes per day** — five times more than in 1950
- Yellow 5 and Yellow 6 together account for roughly **35% of all dye consumption** in the US
- A single serving of mac and cheese can contain **12–17 mg** of Yellow 5 and Yellow 6 combined
- A bag of candy often contains Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Red 40, and Blue 1 — four synthetic dyes in one product

Children are the primary consumers of artificially dyed foods, and their smaller body weight means they receive a higher dose per pound than adults.

## What Other Countries Have Done

The regulatory response to Yellow 5 and Yellow 6 varies significantly:

- **European Union:** Both dyes are legal but require warning labels about effects on children's behavior. Many European manufacturers have voluntarily reformulated to avoid the labels — which is why the same candy brands that use Yellow 5 and Yellow 6 in the US often use natural colorants in Europe.

- **Norway:** Previously banned Yellow 5 and Yellow 6 entirely (the ban was lifted when Norway aligned with EU regulations, but usage remains minimal).

- **United Kingdom:** Follows EU labeling requirements. Many UK manufacturers have removed these dyes voluntarily.

- **Australia/New Zealand:** Requires labeling by name. Advisory labels about hyperactivity are recommended but not mandatory.

- **United States:** No warning labels required. Both dyes are FDA-approved with no restrictions on use in food products marketed to children.

## How to Avoid Yellow 5 and Yellow 6

The most effective approach is reading ingredient labels. These dyes must be listed by name under US labeling requirements. Watch for:

- Yellow 5, FD&C Yellow No. 5, Tartrazine
- Yellow 6, FD&C Yellow No. 6, Sunset Yellow
- Yellow 5 Lake, Yellow 6 Lake (oil-soluble versions used in coatings and chocolate)

Products labeled "no artificial colors" should not contain these dyes. However, "all natural" or "made with real fruit" does not guarantee the absence of synthetic dyes — always check the actual ingredient list.

Natural alternatives that produce yellow and orange colors include:

- **Turmeric extract** — bright golden yellow
- **Annatto** — warm orange-yellow (from achiote seeds)
- **Beta-carotene** — orange (found naturally in carrots and sweet potatoes)
- **Saffron** — golden yellow
- **Paprika extract** — warm orange

At USA Gummies, our yellow and orange gummy bears are colored with turmeric and fruit juice concentrates — no Yellow 5, no Yellow 6, no synthetic dyes at all.

## The Bottom Line

Yellow 5 and Yellow 6 are in thousands of food products — and the research that exists raises legitimate questions about hyperactivity, allergic reactions, and trace carcinogen contamination. The EU requires warning labels. Many European manufacturers have already reformulated.

In the US, no warning labels are required, and these dyes remain in widespread use in products marketed to children.

If you're looking to reduce your family's intake, start with the products where dyes are most concentrated: candy, snack chips, brightly colored cereals, and sports drinks. Reading ingredient labels takes a few extra seconds, but it's the most reliable way to know exactly what you're eating.
