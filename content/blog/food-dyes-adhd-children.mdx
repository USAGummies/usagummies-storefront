If you've watched a child bounce off the walls after a handful of brightly colored candy and thought *"Is it the sugar or is it the dyes?"* — you're asking a question that scientists have been studying for over 50 years.

The short answer: research consistently finds that artificial food dyes can increase hyperactive behavior in some children, including children who have never been diagnosed with ADHD.

Here's what the science actually shows.

## The Southampton Study: The Research That Changed Policy

The most influential study on food dyes and behavior was published in *The Lancet* in 2007 by researchers at the University of Southampton. The study tested two groups of children — ages 3 and ages 8–9 — and found that mixtures of artificial food dyes plus the preservative sodium benzoate significantly increased hyperactive behavior compared to a placebo.

What made this study different from earlier research:

- It used a large sample (over 300 children)
- It was double-blind and placebo-controlled
- It tested *general population* children — not just kids already diagnosed with ADHD
- The effects were statistically significant even in children with no prior behavioral issues

The EU responded to this study by requiring warning labels on foods containing six artificial dyes: Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Ponceau 4R, Quinoline Yellow, and Allura Red. The labels must state: "may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children."

The FDA reviewed the same study but decided not to require labeling.

## What Other Research Shows

The Southampton study wasn't the first to find a connection. Research linking dyes to behavior goes back to Dr. Ben Feingold's work in the 1970s. Since then, the evidence has continued to build:

- A 2012 meta-analysis published in the *Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry* combined data from multiple studies and found a "small but significant" effect of artificial food colors on hyperactive behavior across all children studied.
- The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) published a report in 2021 finding that current FDA-approved levels of dye consumption are not protective of children's behavioral health.
- Multiple elimination diet studies have shown that removing artificial food dyes from children's diets can reduce hyperactive behavior in a subset of children — with some studies finding improvement in as many as 65–75% of participants.

No study claims that food dyes *cause* ADHD. ADHD is a complex neurodevelopmental condition with genetic and environmental factors. But the research suggests that artificial dyes can *worsen* hyperactive symptoms in children who are susceptible — and that some children without ADHD diagnoses are also affected.

## Which Dyes Are Linked to Hyperactivity?

The dyes most commonly studied in connection with hyperactivity are the "Big Six" that carry EU warning labels:

- **Red 40 (Allura Red)** — the most widely used dye in the US, found in candy, snacks, cereals, and beverages
- **Yellow 5 (Tartrazine)** — found in candy, chips, soft drinks, and mac and cheese
- **Yellow 6 (Sunset Yellow)** — found in candy, bakery products, and cereals
- **Red 3 (Erythrosine)** — banned by the FDA in January 2025
- **Blue 1 (Brilliant Blue)** — found in candy, beverages, and frozen treats
- **Blue 2 (Indigo Carmine)** — found in candy and pet food

Most processed candy products contain multiple synthetic dyes. A single bag of candy can contain three or four different artificial colorants.

## What the FDA Has Done (and Hasn't Done)

The FDA banned Red No. 3 in January 2025 after decades of evidence linking it to cancer in lab animals. Manufacturers have until January 2027 to reformulate.

However, the FDA has not taken action on the other five dyes linked to hyperactivity. An FDA advisory committee reviewed the evidence in 2011 and voted 8–6 that the evidence did not warrant a warning label — though several committee members acknowledged the evidence was "suggestive."

In 2024, the state of California passed the California Food Safety Act, which bans Red 3 plus three other additives from foods sold in the state. Multiple other states have introduced legislation targeting additional synthetic dyes.

In early 2026, the FDA announced it would conduct a fresh review of all synthetic food dyes, with results expected in late 2026 or 2027.

## The Elimination Diet Approach

Many pediatricians and child psychologists recommend trying a dye elimination diet for children showing signs of hyperactivity — with or without an ADHD diagnosis. The approach is straightforward:

1. **Remove all artificial food dyes** from the child's diet for 2–4 weeks
2. **Observe behavior** — many parents report changes within the first week
3. **Reintroduce dyes one at a time** to identify which specific colorants trigger reactions
4. **Decide what works** — some families go fully dye-free, others just avoid specific dyes

This isn't about curing ADHD through diet. It's about removing a variable that research shows can worsen symptoms in susceptible children. If you try it and notice a difference, you have useful information. If you don't notice a change, you've ruled something out.

The American Academy of Pediatrics has acknowledged that a "limited elimination diet" is a reasonable approach for children with ADHD symptoms, noting that some children show measurable improvement.

## How to Avoid Artificial Dyes in Candy and Snacks

Reading ingredient labels is the most reliable method. Look for these names:

- Red 40, Red 3, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 1, Blue 2
- FD&C (followed by the color and number)
- Any ingredient listed as a color followed by "Lake" (e.g., Red 40 Lake — this is the oil-soluble version of the same dye)

Brands that use natural colorants instead will typically list ingredients like:

- Vegetable juice (for color)
- Turmeric extract
- Spirulina
- Beet juice
- Fruit and vegetable juice concentrates
- Annatto
- Paprika extract

At USA Gummies, every product uses vegetable and fruit-based colors instead of synthetic dyes. Our gummy bears get their colors from sources like turmeric, spirulina, and beet juice — and they taste exactly the way gummy bears should.

## The Bottom Line

The research doesn't say food dyes cause ADHD. But it consistently shows that artificial food dyes can increase hyperactive behavior in some children — including children without an ADHD diagnosis.

The EU requires warning labels. California has started banning individual dyes. Major candy companies like Mars and Mondelez have announced plans to remove artificial dyes from products by 2028.

If you're a parent wondering whether dyes are affecting your child's behavior, an elimination trial costs nothing and takes a few weeks. Start by swapping out the most heavily dyed items — bright candy, colored cereals, sports drinks — and see what happens.
