In early 2025, the FDA officially revoked the authorization of Red No. 3 — also known as erythrosine or FD&C Red No. 3 — for use in food. Food manufacturers have until January 2027 to remove it from their products.

Here's what you need to know about this dye, why it was banned, and what it means for the candy you buy.

## What Is Red No. 3?

Red No. 3 (erythrosine) is a synthetic food dye that produces a bright cherry-red color. It has been used in foods including candy, cake decorations, fruit cocktail cherries, and some baked goods for decades.

Interestingly, the FDA already banned Red No. 3 from cosmetics and externally applied drugs back in 1990 — but allowed it to remain in food until this year.

## Why Was It Banned?

The FDA revoked authorization based on the Delaney Clause of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which prohibits approval of any food additive shown to cause cancer in humans or animals. Studies had shown that Red No. 3 caused thyroid tumors in male rats at high doses.

It's worth noting that the mechanism of cancer in rats may not directly apply to humans — the scientific community has debated this for years. But the Delaney Clause doesn't require proof of human risk; evidence of cancer in animal studies is sufficient for a ban.

## What About Red No. 40?

Red No. 40 is a different dye — and it hasn't been banned. However, the FDA has encouraged the food industry to voluntarily phase out Red No. 40 and other synthetic dyes in favor of natural alternatives.

Red No. 40 is the most widely used artificial food dye in the United States. It's in everything from candy and snacks to beverages and condiments. In the EU, products containing Red No. 40 must carry a warning label about potential effects on children's behavior.

## The Bigger Regulatory Picture

The Red No. 3 ban is part of a broader shift in US food regulation:

- **May 2025**: The FDA approved three new color additives from natural sources, giving manufacturers more replacement options.
- **2025**: Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has pushed to phase out synthetic food additives more broadly as part of the "Make America Healthy Again" initiative.
- **State-level action**: California banned Red No. 3 and three other additives from food in 2023, ahead of the federal ban.

## Which Candy Still Contains Artificial Dyes?

As of now, many mainstream candy brands still use artificial dyes including Red No. 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, and Blue 1. Mars Wrigley, Kraft Heinz, PepsiCo, and others have announced plans to offer dye-free options, but these transitions are still underway.

If you want to avoid artificial dyes in candy today, look for brands that already use natural color sources. Check the ingredient list for fruit and vegetable extracts, turmeric, spirulina, beet juice, or annatto — these are common natural alternatives.

## How USA Gummies Fits In

USA Gummies has never used Red No. 3, Red No. 40, or any other synthetic FD&C dye. Our gummies use colors from fruit and vegetable extracts, spirulina, and curcumin.

We didn't remove artificial dyes in response to a ban — we launched without them. That's a different starting point than reformulating a product after regulations change.

We're also made in the USA, which means our products are manufactured under FDA oversight from the start, rather than imported and checked at the border.

## What to Do Right Now

If you want to start avoiding artificial dyes in the candy you buy:

1. **Check for Red No. 3** specifically — it's being phased out, but may still be on shelves until 2027
2. **Look at the full dye list**: Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, and Blue 1 are still legal and widely used
3. **Read past the front of the package** — "natural flavors" doesn't mean "no artificial colors"
4. **Look at where it's made** — ingredient standards vary by country of manufacture

The regulatory landscape is shifting fast. But you don't need to wait for every ban to take effect to make different choices today.
