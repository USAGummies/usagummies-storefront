# California Food Dye Ban 2027: What You Need to Know About Red 3 and Beyond

California is leading the charge in food safety with its groundbreaking **2027 ban on Red 3 and other synthetic food dyes**. This move follows the FDA’s nationwide ban on Red 3 in food and ingested drugs, effective January 2027. Whether you’re a parent, educator, or simply a health-conscious consumer, here’s what you need to know about these changes—and how they impact the candy and snacks you love.

## Why Is California Banning Red 3 and Other Food Dyes?

### The Science Behind the Ban
California’s decision to ban Red 3 and other synthetic dyes is rooted in growing concerns about their potential health risks, particularly for children. Studies have linked artificial food dyes to:

- **Hyperactivity and behavioral issues** in children, including increased risk of ADHD-like symptoms.
- **Cancer risks** in animal studies, especially for Red 3 (erythrosine), which was banned from cosmetics in the U.S. in 1990 due to carcinogenic effects in lab rats.
- **Neurobehavioral problems**, as highlighted by the [California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment](https://oehha.ca.gov/risk-assessment/press-release/report-links-synthetic-food-dyes-hyperactivity-and-other).

### California’s Regulatory Leadership
California has long been a pioneer in food safety. In 2023, the state banned **Red 3, brominated vegetable oil, potassium bromate, and propyl paraben** in all foods sold within its borders. In 2024, it expanded these restrictions to **six synthetic dyes in school foods**, including:

- Red Dye No. 40
- Yellow Dye No. 5
- Yellow Dye No. 6
- Blue Dye No. 1
- Blue Dye No. 2
- Green Dye No. 3

These dyes are commonly found in candy, sodas, baked goods, and processed snacks—many of which are staples in school cafeterias. The **California School Food Safety Act**, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, will take full effect on **December 31, 2027**, making California the first state to remove these additives from school meals.

> *“As a lawmaker, a parent, and someone who struggled with ADHD, I find it unacceptable that we allow schools to serve foods with additives that are linked to cancer, hyperactivity, and neurobehavioral harms.”*
> — **Jesse Gabriel (D-Encino)**, California State Assemblyman and author of the bill

### The FDA Follows California’s Lead
In January 2025, the FDA announced a **nationwide ban on Red 3 in food and ingested drugs**, effective January 2027. This decision was influenced by California’s earlier actions and a **2022 petition** citing cancer risks in animal studies. While the FDA noted that the cancer mechanism in rats may not apply to humans, the ban reflects a precautionary approach to food safety.

Manufacturers have until **January 15, 2027**, to reformulate products containing Red 3. This includes thousands of items, from candy and cakes to frozen desserts and medications.

## Which Foods Are Affected by the Ban?

The 2027 bans will impact a wide range of products, particularly:

- **Candy and gummies** (e.g., gummy bears, jelly beans, hard candies)
- **Baked goods** (e.g., cakes, cupcakes, frostings, sprinkles)
- **Frozen desserts** (e.g., ice cream, popsicles, sherbet)
- **Beverages** (e.g., sodas, sports drinks, flavored milks)
- **School cafeteria foods** (e.g., packaged snacks, flavored yogurts, fruit cups)

### How to Identify Banned Dyes on Labels
Always check the **ingredients list** for terms like:

- Red 3 (Erythrosine)
- Red 40 (Allura Red)
- Yellow 5 (Tartrazine)
- Yellow 6 (Sunset Yellow)
- Blue 1 (Brilliant Blue)
- Blue 2 (Indigotine)
- Green 3 (Fast Green)

If you see these, the product contains synthetic dyes that will be banned in California schools by 2027—and, in the case of Red 3, banned nationwide.

## What Are the Safer Alternatives?

### Natural Food Coloring
Many brands are already transitioning to **plant-based, natural alternatives**, such as:

- **Fruit and vegetable juices** (e.g., beet juice, carrot juice, turmeric)
- **Spirulina extract** (for blue/green hues)
- **Annatto** (for yellow/orange shades)
- **Purple sweet potato** (for vibrant purples)

At **USA Gummies**, we’ve always used **natural colors derived from fruits and vegetables**—no synthetic dyes. Our gummy bears, for example, get their bright hues from:

- **Red:** Strawberry and raspberry juice
- **Yellow:** Turmeric and saffron
- **Green:** Spinach and matcha

### Dye-Free Brands to Try
If you’re looking for **dye-free candy and snacks**, consider these brands:

- **USA Gummies** (100% dye-free, made in the USA)
- **YumEarth** (organic, allergen-free)
- **Unreal** (no artificial dyes or ingredients)
- **SmartSweets** (low-sugar, naturally colored)

## What Does This Mean for Parents and Schools?

### For Parents
- **Read labels carefully** when shopping for snacks, especially for school lunches.
- **Opt for dye-free brands** to avoid synthetic additives.
- **Advocate for healthier school food policies** in your district.

### For Schools
- **Review cafeteria menus** and phase out products containing banned dyes by December 2027.
- **Partner with dye-free suppliers** to ensure compliance.
- **Educate students and parents** about the benefits of natural food coloring.

## The Bigger Picture: A Shift Toward Cleaner Food

California’s ban is part of a **global trend** toward cleaner, more transparent food labeling. Many countries, including those in the **European Union, Australia, and New Zealand**, have already banned Red 3 and other synthetic dyes. The U.S. is now catching up, driven by **consumer demand for safer, more natural ingredients**.

### How You Can Support the Movement
1. **Choose dye-free products** whenever possible.
2. **Encourage local schools** to adopt dye-free policies.
3. **Spread awareness** about the health risks of synthetic dyes.
4. **Support brands** that prioritize natural ingredients.

## Conclusion

California’s **2027 food dye ban** is a major step forward for food safety, especially for children. By removing Red 3 and other synthetic dyes from schools and reformulating products, the state is setting a new standard for the nation. As a consumer, you can **vote with your wallet** by choosing dye-free brands like **USA Gummies**—because everyone deserves candy that’s as safe as it is delicious.
