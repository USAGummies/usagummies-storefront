Red 40 (also labeled Allura Red AC, FD&C Red No. 40, or E129) is the most widely used artificial food dye in the United States. It shows up in everything from gummy bears to fruit snacks to hard candies — and it's the dye parents search for most when checking labels.

After the FDA banned Red No. 3 in January 2025 and Mars announced plans to remove artificial dyes from its entire lineup, more people than ever are asking: which candies actually contain Red 40?

We went through the ingredient labels so you don't have to.

## Candies that contain Red 40

These popular candy brands list Red 40 (Allura Red AC) on their ingredient labels as of early 2026. Formulations can change, so always check the package you're buying.

## Candies that are Red 40 free

These brands have already removed artificial dyes or never used them:

- **USA Gummies** — No Red 40 or any artificial dyes. Colors come from fruit and vegetable extracts (beet juice, turmeric, spirulina, carrot). Made in the USA.
- **YumEarth** — Organic, plant-based colors from fruit and vegetable concentrates.
- **Surf Sweets** — Colored with organic fruit and vegetable juice.
- **Unreal Candy** — No artificial colors in any products.
- **SmartSweets** — Uses plant-based colors.

- **Hu Kitchen** — No artificial anything, including dyes.
- **Justin's** — Peanut butter cups use no artificial colors.

## How to check for Red 40 on labels

Red 40 can appear under several names on ingredient labels:

- Red 40
- Allura Red AC
- Allura Red
- FD&C Red No. 40
- E129 (European labeling)
- CI 16035 (color index number)

It's always listed in the ingredients section, usually near the end alongside other artificial colors. If you see any of the color names above, or "artificial colors" / "color added," the product likely contains synthetic dyes.

## Why people avoid Red 40

Red 40 is approved by the FDA for use in food, but it has drawn scrutiny for several reasons:

- **Behavioral concerns:** Multiple studies have examined possible links between Red 40 and hyperactivity in children. The European Union requires warning labels on foods containing Red 40 stating the dye "may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children."
- **Allergic reactions:** Some people report sensitivity reactions including hives and headaches.
- **Petroleum origin:** Red 40 is synthesized from petroleum byproducts, which some consumers prefer to avoid.
- **California disclosure:** California passed a law requiring disclosure of certain artificial dyes in foods sold in schools.

The FDA's position is that Red 40 is safe at current levels of consumption, though the agency continues to review emerging research.

## The bigger picture

Red 40 is just one of several artificial food dyes commonly used in candy. Others include:

| Dye | Common name | Status |
|-----|------------|--------|
| Red No. 3 | Erythrosine | **Banned by FDA** (Jan 2025) |
| Red No. 40 | Allura Red | Approved (warning labels in EU) |
| Yellow No. 5 | Tartrazine | Approved (warning labels in EU) |
| Yellow No. 6 | Sunset Yellow | Approved (warning labels in EU) |
| Blue No. 1 | Brilliant Blue | Approved |
| Blue No. 2 | Indigo Carmine | Approved |

The trend is clearly moving toward fewer artificial dyes in food. Major manufacturers including Mars, General Mills, Kraft Heinz, and PepsiCo/Frito-Lay have announced reformulation plans, though timelines vary.

## Finding candy without Red 40

If you're looking to avoid Red 40, here are practical tips:

1. **Check the ingredient label** — look for any of the names listed above
2. **Look for "no artificial colors"** on the front of the package
3. **Choose organic options** — USDA Organic rules prohibit synthetic dyes
4. **Check our [dye-free candy guide](/dye-free-candy)** for a deeper breakdown of what to look for
5. **Try USA Gummies** — we've been dye-free from day one, with colors from fruit and vegetable extracts
