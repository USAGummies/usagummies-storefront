With the FDA banning Red No. 3, Mars announcing dye-free M&M's and Skittles, and nearly every major food company pledging to reduce artificial dyes — finding candy without synthetic colors has never been easier.

But there's a difference between brands that are *planning* to go dye-free and brands that already are. Here's a look at where things stand in 2026.

## What "Dye-Free" Actually Means

When we say dye-free, we mean candy that doesn't use FD&C (Food, Drug & Cosmetic) synthetic color additives. The most common ones in American candy are:

- **Red 40** (Allura Red) — the most widely used artificial dye in the US
- **Yellow 5** (Tartrazine)
- **Yellow 6** (Sunset Yellow)
- **Blue 1** (Brilliant Blue)
- **Red 3** (Erythrosine) — now banned by the FDA, being removed by 2027

Dye-free brands use natural color sources instead: fruit juice, vegetable juice, turmeric, beet juice, spirulina, annatto, and other plant-derived ingredients.

## Brands That Are Already Dye-Free

### USA Gummies

Gummy bears made without any artificial dyes since the brand launched in 2024. Colors come from fruit and vegetable extracts, spirulina, and turmeric. Also made in the USA — not imported. Available in multiple flavors.

What they skip: Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 1, titanium dioxide, and all other synthetic FD&C dyes.

### YumEarth

One of the earliest brands to commit to organic, dye-free candy. Their product line includes lollipops, gummy bears, fruit snacks, and licorice. Colors come from fruit and vegetable concentrates. Widely available in grocery stores.

### Surf Sweets

Owned by the same parent company as YumEarth. Surf Sweets makes gummy bears, gummy worms, and other chewy candies using organic fruit juice and natural colors. Their products are also free from corn syrup and gluten.

### Unreal Candy

Known for chocolate-coated candies that are direct alternatives to mainstream brands. Unreal uses natural colors in products like their candy-coated chocolates and peanut butter cups. No artificial dyes, no corn syrup.

### Smart Sweets

Focused on low-sugar gummy candy. Smart Sweets uses natural colors from fruit and vegetable juice concentrates. Their gummy bears, sour gummies, and other products are available in most major retailers.

### Black Forest (Organic line)

Black Forest offers an organic gummy bear line that uses juice from real fruit for color. Note: their conventional (non-organic) products still contain artificial dyes, so check labels carefully.

## Brands Transitioning to Dye-Free (2025–2026)

These companies have announced plans but haven't fully completed the switch:

- **Mars Wrigley** — Dye-free *options* for M&M's, Skittles, Starburst, and Extra Gum starting in 2026. Original dyed versions will still be sold alongside them.
- **Kraft Heinz** — Announced dye removal plans in June 2025.
- **General Mills** — Announced candy dye removal (they already removed dyes from cereals in 2016).
- **PepsiCo** — Pledged to reduce synthetic dyes across snack brands.
- **The Hershey Company** — Announced dye reduction plans.
- **Nestlé USA** — Removed artificial colors from chocolate products in 2015; expanding to other categories.

## How to Check Any Candy

If a brand isn't on this list, here's how to check for yourself:

1. **Flip the bag over** — the ingredient list tells you everything
2. **Look for FD&C dyes by name**: Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 1, Red 3
3. **Look for natural alternatives**: fruit juice, vegetable juice, turmeric, beet juice, spirulina, annatto, paprika extract
4. **"Natural flavors" ≠ "no artificial colors"** — these are separate things
5. **Check the country of origin** — ingredient standards vary by country of manufacture

## The Bottom Line

The dye-free candy market is growing fast. Major brands are making pledges, but many are still months or years away from actually delivering reformulated products. If you want dye-free candy today — not a promise for next year — look for brands that are already there.
