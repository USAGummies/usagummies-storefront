Candy labels often mention color, but the source of that color can vary widely. If you are trying to choose between natural color candy and candy made with artificial dyes, this guide will help you understand the differences and read labels with confidence. The [shop page](/shop) is a useful snapshot of current gummy options as you compare labels.

## What are artificial dyes in candy?

Artificial dyes are synthetic color additives used to create bright, consistent colors in candy. They are usually listed by name in the ingredient list.

Common examples include:

- Red 40
- Yellow 5
- Yellow 6
- Blue 1
- Blue 2

## What is natural color candy?

Natural color candy uses color sources derived from fruits, vegetables, or other natural ingredients. The exact sources vary by brand, but they should be listed in the ingredient statement.

## How labels describe color sources

Labels can use different phrasing even when the approach is similar. Here are typical label patterns:

- "No artificial colors"
- "Colored with fruit and vegetable concentrates"
- A specific color source listed in the ingredient list

The ingredient list is the best way to confirm what you are buying.

## Choosing candy for events and parties

If you are planning a party, natural color candy can still provide the color you need when paired with fruit or other snacks. A simple mix of gummies, berries, and popcorn can create a balanced table without artificial dyes.

## Shopping tips for natural color gummies

When you are ready to compare products, focus on:

- A clear ingredient list with no artificial dye names
- A product description that matches the ingredient statement
