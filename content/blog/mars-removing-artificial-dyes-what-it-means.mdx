In July 2025, Mars Wrigley — the company behind M&M's, Skittles, Starburst, and dozens of other candy brands — announced that it will offer versions of four products made without synthetic food dyes starting in 2026.

It was one of the biggest announcements in the candy industry in years. And if you've been paying attention to ingredient labels, it was a long time coming.

## What Mars Actually Announced

Let's be specific about what's changing. Mars Wrigley confirmed that four products will get dye-free options:

- **M&M's Chocolate**
- **Skittles Original**
- **Starburst Original Fruit Chews**
- **Extra Gum Spearmint**

These new versions will be made without FD&C (Food, Drug & Cosmetic) color additives — the synthetic dyes like Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, and Blue 1 that currently give these candies their signature colors.

Mars Wrigley President Anton Vincent said the company's approach is "consumer-focused and science-led."

## What's Not Changing (Yet)

Here's the part that's easy to miss: these are **additional options**, not replacements. The original versions with artificial dyes aren't going away. Mars hasn't committed to removing synthetic dyes from their full product portfolio.

This matters. If you're shopping for dye-free candy, you'll need to read labels carefully to make sure you're getting the new version — not the original.

Mars actually made a similar commitment back in 2016, pledging to remove artificial dyes from their entire lineup within five years. That pledge was later walked back after the company said their research showed many consumers didn't consider artificial colors a concern.

## Why the Shift Is Happening Now

Several things are converging at once:

**Regulatory pressure is building.** The FDA banned Red No. 3 in early 2025, with full removal from foods required by 2027. The agency has also encouraged the industry to phase out Red No. 40. In May 2025, the FDA approved three new color additives from natural sources, giving manufacturers more natural alternatives to work with.

**It's not just Mars.** Kraft Heinz and General Mills announced their own dye removal plans in June 2025. PepsiCo, ConAgra, The Hershey Company, McCormick, J.M. Smucker, and Nestlé USA have all announced similar moves.

**Consumer demand has been shifting for years.** More shoppers are reading labels, especially parents buying snacks for kids. The connection between artificial dyes and behavioral effects in children — while still debated — has driven a meaningful percentage of consumers toward dye-free options.

## What This Means If You Already Avoid Artificial Dyes

If you've already switched to dye-free candy, this news is validation. The largest candy companies in the world are now investing in the same thing smaller, ingredient-focused brands have been doing all along.

At USA Gummies, we've never used artificial dyes. Our gummies get their colors from real ingredients — turmeric, beet juice, spirulina, fruit and vegetable juices. That's been the case since day one, not as a response to regulatory pressure or market trends.

We're also made in the USA. That's worth mentioning because several of the brands making these announcements manufacture overseas, where ingredient standards and regulations can differ significantly.

## The Bigger Picture

The candy industry is changing. When companies as large as Mars, Kraft Heinz, and PepsiCo all move in the same direction within months of each other, it signals something real.

But there's a difference between a company offering a dye-free option alongside its existing products, and a company that was built dye-free from the start. The supply chains are different. The ingredient sourcing is different. The priorities are different.

If you're looking for candy that's already dye-free — not *planning* to offer a dye-free option sometime next year — brands like USA Gummies exist today. No artificial dyes, no titanium dioxide, made in the USA, available right now.

## How to Shop for Dye-Free Candy Today

Until the big brands complete their transitions, here's what to look for on labels:

- **Avoid**: Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 1, Red 3 (if still on shelves)
- **Look for**: Colors from fruit juice, vegetable juice, turmeric, beet juice, spirulina, annatto
- **Check the country of origin**: "Distributed by" a US company doesn't mean "made in" the USA
- **Read the full ingredient list**: "Natural flavors" doesn't automatically mean "no artificial colors" — they're separate things

The industry is heading in the right direction. But you don't have to wait for 2026 to eat candy without synthetic dyes. That option has been available for a while now.
