### Post 1 — FDA Ban News Hook
```
The FDA banned Red No. 3 from food in 2025.

But Red No. 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, and Blue 1 are still in most candy.

We've never used any of them.

```

### Post 2 — Mars/Skittles News Hook
```
Mars says M&M's and Skittles will have dye-free OPTIONS in 2026.

Not replacements. Options.

And they made this same promise in 2016 and walked it back.

Meanwhile, brands already exist that never had artificial dyes to begin with 🇺🇸

```

### Post 3 — EU vs US Angle
```
In Europe, candy with artificial dyes must carry a warning label.

In the US? No warning. Same brands, different ingredients depending on which country you buy in.

Why?

```

### Post 4 — Timeline Teaser
```
2010: EU requires dye warning labels
2016: Mars promises to remove dyes (walks it back)
2024: USA Gummies launches dye-free
2025: FDA bans Red No. 3
2026: Mars offers "options"

```

### Post 5 — Direct Product Push
```
No Red 40. No Yellow 5. No Blue 1. No titanium dioxide.

Just gummy bears colored with real fruit and vegetable extracts. Made in the USA.

We didn't need a ban to do the right thing.

### Feed Post 2 — Single Image: Ingredient Comparison
**Caption:**
```
Same candy. Different countries. Different ingredients.

In Europe, many candy brands reformulated to natural colors after warning labels were required. In the US? They kept the artificial dyes.

Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6 — all still in most American candy. All require warning labels in Europe.

We use colors from fruit & vegetable extracts, spirulina, and turmeric. Always have.

### Post 1 — News Share: Mars Announcement
```
Mars Wrigley says dye-free M&M's and Skittles are coming in 2026.

But here's what the headlines aren't telling you:

→ These are "options" — the dyed versions aren't going away
→ Mars made this exact same promise in 2016 and walked it back
→ Kraft Heinz, General Mills, PepsiCo, and Hershey are all making similar announcements
→ Meanwhile, some brands have been dye-free since they launched

We wrote up what's actually changing (and what isn't):

### Post 2 — Community Question
```
Quick question for parents:

Do you check candy labels for artificial dyes before buying for your kids?

The FDA just banned Red No. 3, but Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, and Blue 1 are still in most candy on shelves.

In Europe, those same dyes require a warning label about effects on children's behavior.

We put together a guide on what to look for:
