## ⚡ QUICK TIPS
- Shoot all 5 back to back — same setup, same outfit, same energy
- Each video should feel like a friend telling you something surprising, not a sales pitch
- Never say "buy" or "check out" — end with the brand name and "link in bio"
- Use trending sounds when possible, but original voiceover works better for information-dense content
- Caption every video — 80%+ of TikTok/Reels are watched on mute
