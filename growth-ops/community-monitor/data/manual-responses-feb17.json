    "response_template": "Oh man, I feel this so hard. My 11yo will demolish an entire box of fruit snacks in one sitting if I don't portion them out ahead of time. What finally helped us was switching to snacks that are a little more filling and less \"grab and inhale\" — things like cheese, nuts, or gummies that are actually made with real ingredients instead of the super processed stuff. I started reading labels more after the whole Red 3 dye ban news and honestly it changed how I stock the pantry. There are some solid dye-free gummy options out there now that my kids actually like and don't disappear in 30 seconds flat. Hang in there, growth spurts are no joke at that age.",

    "response_template": "Dense and chewy is such an underrated gummy texture. Most American gummies are so soft they basically dissolve — I actually prefer something with a bit of resistance. Have you tried any of the brands doing gummies with pectin instead of gelatin? Totally different chew, closer to what you're describing here. I've been exploring a bunch of smaller gummy brands lately, especially ones skipping artificial dyes and using fruit-based colors. Some of them nail the texture way better than the big name stuff. Would love to know what flavor that corn candy actually was though — sweet? Savory? I'm so curious.",

It's wild how few candy brands are upfront about allergens and what's actually in their stuff. I've started paying more attention to ingredient lists in general lately, not just allergens but dyes and artificial junk too. There are some newer gummy brands that are really transparent about being dye-free and made with simple ingredients. Once you start caring about one thing on the label you end up caring about all of it, haha. Hope the cherry cola ones were as good as they sound!",

It's funny how candy from back then felt so much simpler — fewer ingredients, less neon coloring, just straightforward flavors. I've been on a bit of a kick lately trying to find gummies and candy that have that same vibe, like actually made with real stuff instead of a chemistry set. The dye-free gummy space has gotten surprisingly good recently. Something about simpler ingredients just hits different, nostalgia or not.",

I've been trying a ton of different gummies lately and one thing I started doing is actually flipping the bag over before I buy. It's kind of alarming how many gummy brands still load up on Red 40 and Blue 1 — stuff that's already banned in a bunch of other countries. Not trying to be preachy about it, I just think it's worth knowing what you're eating. There are some newer brands doing dye-free gummies with colors from actual fruit and vegetable juice and the flavor is legit. Anyway, how's the sour level on the Juicy Drops?",
