## Internal Linking Strategy

Every page in the dye-free content cluster should link to:
1. `/dye-free-candy` — Hub page (most important for SEO authority)
2. `/go` or `/shop` — Purchase pages (conversion)
3. At least 1 blog post in the cluster (topical relevance)
4. `/vs` — Comparison hub (competitor capture)
5. `/dye-free-movement` — Timeline (topical depth)

Current internal link structure (Feb 16):
```
/dye-free-candy ↔ /dye-free-movement ↔ /vs
    ↕                    ↕                ↕
blog/fda-ban ↔ blog/mars-dyes ↔ blog/eu-vs-us
```

All 3 new blog posts cross-link to each other, the timeline, and the hub. ✓
The /vs page links to the timeline. ✓
The /dye-free-candy page links to both the timeline and /vs. ✓
