## 2. BULLET POINTS

### Bullet 1 — Primary Benefit (Dye-Free, Natural Colors)
```
NATURALLY COLORED WITH REAL INGREDIENTS — While other candy brands are just now scrambling to remove artificial dyes in 2026, USA Gummies has been dye-free since day one. Every gummy gets its color from nature: spirulina for blue and green, turmeric and curcumin for yellow, beet juice for red, and fruit and vegetable extracts throughout. Zero synthetic dyes. Zero compromise. This is what candy should have been all along.
```
**Character count:** 432 / 500

### Bullet 2 — Made in USA
```
PROUDLY MADE IN THE USA — Every bag of USA Gummies is produced right here in America using domestic manufacturing standards. No overseas mystery ingredients, no cutting corners. We believe American families deserve candy made with American quality and transparency. From sourcing to packaging, this is a product you can feel good about buying and sharing.

**Character count:** 365 / 500

### Bullet 3 — What's NOT In Them
```
NO RED 40, NO YELLOW 5, NO YELLOW 6, NO BLUE 1, NO TITANIUM DIOXIDE — Read the back of your current gummy bear bag. If you see FD&C dyes or titanium dioxide on the label, it is time for an upgrade. USA Gummies contain none of the artificial color additives that the FDA and parents nationwide are raising concerns about. Just clean, simple ingredients you can actually pronounce.
```
**Character count:** 381 / 500

### Bullet 4 — Taste and Texture
```
TASTES AMAZING, NOT "HEALTHY" — Let's be honest: nobody wants a gummy bear that tastes like a compromise. USA Gummies are soft, chewy, bursting with fruit flavor, and every bit as delicious as the legacy brands you grew up on. The only difference is what is NOT inside. Your kids will not know they are eating dye-free candy. They will just know they love it.
```
**Character count:** 368 / 500

### Bullet 5 — Perfect For
```
PERFECT FOR FAMILIES, LUNCHBOXES, PARTIES & GIFTING — Great for parents who read labels, kids who love gummy bears, school-safe snack days, birthday party candy bowls, holiday stockings, and anyone making the switch to dye-free. Also a smart choice for offices, movie nights, road trips, and care packages. One bag, zero guilt, and a candy you are genuinely proud to hand out.

## 3. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

```
The Candy Industry Is Finally Catching Up. We Were Already Here.

In January 2025, the FDA banned Red No. 3. By 2026, Mars, Kraft Heinz, General Mills, PepsiCo, and Hershey all announced plans to remove artificial dyes from their products. The dye-free movement is no longer fringe — it is the future of American food.

But USA Gummies did not wait for a government ban or a press release. We launched dye-free from the start in 2024, because we believed families should not have to choose between candy that tastes good and candy that is made right.

Every bag of USA Gummies Dye-Free Gummy Bears is colored entirely with natural sources: spirulina, turmeric, curcumin, beet juice, and fruit and vegetable extracts. No Red 40. No Yellow 5. No Yellow 6. No Blue 1. No titanium dioxide. Just real colors from real ingredients, made in the USA.

The result? A soft, flavorful gummy bear with a 4.8-star rating from customers who notice the difference — and kids who just think they taste incredible.

Whether you are a parent eliminating artificial dyes from your household, stocking up for a birthday party, or simply looking for a better gummy bear, USA Gummies is the choice that was here before the trend and will be here long after.

Try a bag today and taste what dye-free candy is supposed to be.

## NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION

1. **Title** — Paste directly into Seller Central > Listing > Product Title. Verify character count renders fully on mobile (some categories truncate around 150 chars on mobile search results; the critical keywords are front-loaded to account for this).

2. **Bullet Points** — Paste into the 5 "Key Product Features" fields in Seller Central. CAPS lead-ins are standard Amazon best practice and improve scan-ability.

3. **Product Description** — Paste into the Description field. If A+ Content is active, this field may be hidden on the detail page, but it still indexes for search. Keep it populated.

4. **Backend Search Terms** — Seller Central > Keywords > Search Terms. Paste one line per field. Do not repeat words already in the title (Amazon de-dupes). No commas needed — space-separated is correct.

5. **A+ Content** — Build in Seller Central > A+ Content Manager. Use the "Standard comparison chart" module for Module 1, "Standard image and text" for Modules 2 and 3, and "Standard single image and sidebar" or custom layout for the timeline in Module 4.

6. **Legal/Compliance Reminders:**
   - All claims are factual and verifiable (dye-free since 2024, specific natural color sources, FDA ban is public record)
   - No health claims are made (we do not say dye-free is "healthier," just what the ingredients are and are not)
   - No competitor brand names are used in backend search terms (Amazon policy prohibits this)
   - No mention of the supplier/manufacturer by name
   - Star rating referenced (4.8) should be updated if it changes

7. **Seasonal Updates:**
   - Swap Module 5 bullet "holiday stockings" for seasonal terms as appropriate (Easter baskets in spring, Halloween candy in fall, etc.)
   - Monitor news cycle — if additional FDA actions or major brand announcements happen, update the timeline in Module 4 and the product description accordingly
