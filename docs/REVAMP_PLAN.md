# Full Revamp Plan — Parchment Americana + Premium Candy

## Constraints (non-negotiable)
- PR-only; nothing hits production without Ben approval.
- No changes to pricing logic.
- No changes to free shipping thresholds.
- No changes to atomic inventory model.
- No paid ads. Organic traffic only.
- Social: Truth Social only (remove other social links).

## Goals
- Premium, cohesive brand system that feels like a $400M brand.
- Strong above-the-fold conversion experience.
- Organic traffic engine (SEO + internal linking + content architecture).

## Design direction
- Replace metal/steel sheen with constitutional parchment / letterpress / ink texture.
- Keep white + navy dominant; red as accent; gold restrained.
- Candy cues via controlled warm highlights + product color pops.

## Deliverables
1) Global design tokens (parchment surfaces, ink, shadow, borders, texture utilities).
2) Homepage hero rebuild: manifesto + proof bar + premium media framing + simplified rhythm.
3) System-wide layout coherence: containers, section spacing, headings, CTAs.
4) SEO hardening: canonicals, querystring parameter handling, internal linking blocks.
5) Preview watermark: branch + commit SHA to avoid caching ambiguity.

## Review checklist
- Home hero: instant clarity + desire.
- Shop: obvious path, premium trust.
- PDP: same.
- Cart: no friction.
- Ingredients/Policies: premium readability.
- Mobile: tap targets + layout.
